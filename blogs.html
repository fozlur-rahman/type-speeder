                <h3>What difference between the Global scope & Block scope?</h3>
                <p>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold">Global scope: </span> The variables
                    defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as
                    global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the
                    variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                    function or conditional state can access that variable. <br />
                    <br />
                    <span style="font-weight: bold">Block scope: </span>Block scope is
                    also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as
                    the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these
                    curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
                    something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables
                    from within the curly brackets {}.

                <p>
                    The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous
                    programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but
                    using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
                    multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the
                    operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished,
                    it is popped from the stack. The event queue is responsible for
                    sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
                    queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all
                    operations should be sent for execution.

                <h3>What difference between the localstorage & sessionstorage ?</h3>
                <p>
                    SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that
                    while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is
                    cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in
                    a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created
                    and assigned to that particular tab.
